          <p><strong>Gravitationally Enhanced Temporal Resolution</strong> is the main idea of the VSPD framework. This isn't about "zooming in" in space—it's about how time runs differently near massive objects.</p>
          <p>In normal (flat) spacetime, our measurements effectively average over a span of time. That "blur" hides underlying deterministic structure. Near strong gravity, time dilation narrows that effective span, so we can see structure that was previously averaged away.</p>

            <p><strong>1. Temporal coarse-graining:</strong> The quantum wavefunction is a temporal ensemble average. In flat spacetime that produces a time-averaged projection that hides deterministic behavior.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Gravitational resolution enhancement:</strong> Strong gravity narrows the effective measurement epoch, so we see more detail—supporting hidden-variable views.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Extended spacetime structures:</strong> Coherent geodesic bundles become visible under strong gravitational fields.</p>

      <p>The quantum wavefunction is not an expression of fundamental ontological randomness, but a <strong style="color:#e4e4e7">temporal ensemble average</strong> resulting from a non-zero measurement epoch (Δt). In flat spacetime, this epoch produces a <strong style="color:#e4e4e7">time-averaged projection</strong> that obscures underlying deterministic dynamics—<strong style="color:#e4e4e7">temporal coarse-graining</strong>.</p>
      <p>Gravitational gradients induce significant <strong style="color:#3b82f6">time dilation</strong>. Near massive bodies, the effective measurement epoch narrows, acting as a <strong style="color:#6366f1">gravitational resolution enhancement</strong>. This relativistic narrowing sharpens the observation of deterministic systems typically obscured by flat-spacetime coarse-graining.</p>
      <p>Extended spacetime structures—coherent geodesic bundles within the manifold—become resolvable when observed under sufficiently strong gravitational fields. The VSPD framework formalizes this and connects it to empirical signatures in cosmology, gravitational-wave spectroscopy, and stellar astrophysics.</p>
