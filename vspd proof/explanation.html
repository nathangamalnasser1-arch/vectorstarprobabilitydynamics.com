    <h1>Explanation — In Plain Language</h1>
    <p>
      This page explains everything in simple terms: what the data is, what we mean by probability,
      and why we are trying an alternative representation. <strong>This does not replace quantum mechanics.</strong>
    </p>

      <h2>What is CERN data?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>CERN</strong> is the European laboratory for particle physics. It runs the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
        where beams of protons (or other particles) are smashed together at very high energies. Huge detectors
        like <strong>CMS</strong> (Compact Muon Solenoid) record the debris: positions, momenta, and energies of
        particles produced in each collision.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>CERN Open Data</strong> is a program that releases some of this data (and simulations) to the public.
        We use CMS Open Data — in particular, simulated <strong>muon</strong> collision events — so we can
        visualize and reinterpret the same kind of information that physicists use, without running the real
        experiment ourselves.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>What is a muon?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>muon</strong> is a fundamental particle, similar to the electron but about 200 times heavier.
        It has the same negative electric charge as the electron and is created in many high-energy collisions
        (e.g. when cosmic rays hit the atmosphere, or in LHC collisions). Muons are used in CMS as one of the
        main “signatures” of interesting physics because they are relatively easy to detect and measure. In our
        visualization, each point or trajectory represents a muon (or other particle) with a position and
        momentum at a given event index (time step).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>What does “probability” mean in physics?</h2>
      <p>
        In quantum mechanics, we don’t say “the particle is exactly here”; we say “there is a certain
        <strong>probability</strong> of finding it here if we measure.” That probability is usually represented
        as a number between 0 and 1 (or as a probability density). The same idea applies when we look at many
        collision events: we can build a probability distribution over where particles tend to be and how they
        tend to move. So when we talk about “probability” in this project, we mean: a measure of how likely
        it is to find a particle in a given region or state, derived from the data (or from a model).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Scalar probability vs vector probability</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Scalar probability</strong> is a single number at each point: “how much” probability is there
        (e.g. brightness or radius in our standard mode). It doesn’t tell you a “direction” of flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vector probability (VSPD)</strong> adds direction: at each point we have not only a magnitude
        but a vector showing the direction and strength of “probability flow.” So instead of only “how much,”
        we see “how much and in which way it’s changing or moving” over discrete time steps. That’s what we
        call Vector Star Probability Dynamics: probability represented and animated as a vector field.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why is an alternative representation useful?</h2>
      <p>
        The standard interpretation of quantum mechanics (with scalar probability densities) is well established
        and correct. An alternative representation can still be useful for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intuition</strong> — Some people find it easier to think in terms of flows and directions.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualization</strong> — Vector fields can reveal structure (e.g. vortices, sinks, sources)
          that might be less obvious from scalar maps alone.</li>
        <li><strong>Education</strong> — Comparing both views side by side can deepen understanding of what
          “probability” means in physics.</li>
        <li><strong>Research</strong> — Exploring alternative formulations can sometimes suggest new questions
          or connections, even if they don’t replace the standard theory.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So we are not claiming that VSPD replaces quantum mechanics; we are exploring whether a vector-field
        view of probability can be a helpful complement for visualization and understanding.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        We use <strong>CERN CMS Open Data</strong> (simulated muon events) to animate particle motion by
        <strong>event_index</strong>. We show two modes: <strong>Standard</strong> (probability as scalar
        brightness/radius) and <strong>VSPD</strong> (probability as a vector field with direction and
        magnitude, animated over time). Everything is explained in the <a href="math.html">Math & AI</a> page
        and implemented in a fully static, deterministic way on the <a href="experiment.html">Experiment</a> page.
        This project emphasizes that the alternative representation does <strong>not</strong> replace
        quantum mechanics — it is an exploratory visualization and conceptual tool.
