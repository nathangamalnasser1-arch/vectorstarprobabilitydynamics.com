    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      This site was created as a static, educational visualization of CERN CMS Open Data using
      an alternative representation of particle probability — Vector Star Probability Dynamics (VSPD).

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        The creator has experience in <strong>Big Data</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>: working with
        large datasets, pipelines, and machine learning in practice. This includes hands-on work with
        <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, <strong>scikit-learn</strong>, and early cloud-based notebooks
        for data science and model prototyping.

      <h2>Independent research</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>vectorstarprobabilitydynamics.com</strong> was created as an independent research
        achievement — exploring the idea of representing probability as a vector field (direction and
        magnitude) and animating its evolution over time, in parallel to standard scalar probability
        interpretation. This CERN Open Data project extends that idea by grounding it in real
        particle-physics data (CMS simulated muon events) and providing a clear, open, and fully
        static visualization that anyone can run in a browser.

      <p>
        No backend, no frameworks: vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All animations are deterministic
        and reproducible. The goal is clarity, education, and scientific honesty: we state clearly that
        this alternative representation does <strong>not</strong> replace quantum mechanics — it is a
        complementary visualization and conceptual tool.
